# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project repository! This project focuses on analyzing and exploring a dataset to extract meaningful insights and prepare the data for further modeling or decision-making processes.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

- **Understand the Dataset**: Gain insights into the structure, variables, and relationships present in the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary transformations to make the data suitable for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory analysis to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.
- **Key Findings and Insights**: Present key findings and insights derived from the analysis, highlighting trends, patterns, and potential relationships within the data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of ratings across various criteria related to job applicants. Each row represents an applicant, and each column represents a different evaluation category. Here's a breakdown of the main features or variables in the dataset:

- **Academic record**: Ratings based on the applicant's academic achievements.
- **Appearance**: Ratings based on the applicant's appearance during the interview process.
- **Communication**: Ratings based on the applicant's communication skills.
- **Company Fit**: Ratings based on how well the applicant fits into the company culture.
- **Experience**: Ratings based on the applicant's relevant work experience.
- **Job Fit**: Ratings based on how well the applicant fits the requirements of the job.
- **Letter**: Ratings based on the applicant's recommendation or cover letter.
- **Likeability**: Ratings based on the interviewer's perception of the applicant's likability.
- **Organization**: Ratings based on the applicant's organizational skills.
- **Potential**: Ratings based on the perceived potential of the applicant for future growth.
- **Resume**: Ratings based on the quality and relevance of the applicant's resume.
- **Self-Confidence**: Ratings based on the applicant's level of self-confidence during the interview.

This dataset is typically used to assess and compare job applicants based on multiple criteria to determine their suitability for a particular role or organization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Directory containing the dataset file(s).
- **`notebooks/`**: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and visualization.
- **`scripts/`**: Directory containing any scripts used for data cleaning, preprocessing, or specific analyses.
- **`results/`**: Directory for storing any results, figures, or output generated during the analysis.

## Usage

To replicate or explore the analysis performed in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
